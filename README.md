# NLP-project-Womens-Clothing-E-Commerce-Reviews
   Project Description:
This project aims to analyze women's clothing e-commerce reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used in this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 23,486 customer reviews for women's clothing products, along with several features such as product category, age group, and rating.

The project includes the following main steps:

Data preprocessing: cleaning the text data, removing stop words, stemming or lemmatization, and creating a corpus.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): exploring the dataset to understand its characteristics and relationships between different features.

Sentiment analysis: using NLP techniques such as sentiment lexicons or machine learning algorithms to classify the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

Topic modeling: identifying the main topics in the reviews using techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).

Text classification: building a machine learning model to classify the reviews into different categories based on their content.

Visualization: creating visualizations such as word clouds, bar charts, or scatterplots to better understand the results and communicate them effectively.
